A collection of miscellaneous materials that I wanted to share.

## quadprog

The Stan-comaptible C++  implementation of the algorithm of Goldfarb and Idnani for the solution of a (convex) Quadratic Programming problem. The initial implementation was made by Charles Margossian and was later improved by me and Thomas Vladeck and made suitable to use and an external .hpp file with CmdStan or RStan.

## stan-talk-calibrated

The slides and code used for the talk "State and evolution of Stan" for the Calibrated Webcast series by Generable.

## expose-cmdstanr-functions

A way to exposing Stan user-defined functions using CmdStanR and Rcpp.
